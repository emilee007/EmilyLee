    <h2>Zemoga</h2>
    <h4>branding, packaging, print</h4>
    <p>As a graphic design intern at <a href="http://www.zemoga.com">Zemoga</a>, I designed brand materials for Zemoga and <a href="http://www.pixelsandpills.com">Pixels and Pills</a>, Zemoga's digital health community. I enjoyed working on the Zemoga brand since it uses many icons and bright colors. Zemoga often designed giveaways for clients, and I had fun designing laptop cases, coffee packaging, and notepads.</p>
