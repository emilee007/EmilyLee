    <p>As a Visual Designer at <a href="http://www.isobar.com/us/home">Isobar</a>, I helped design t-shirts for the Isobar team participating in <a href="http://bronxzoo.com/run-for-the-wild">Run for the Wild</a>. Run for the Wild is an annual 5K marathon at the Bronx Zoo supporting the Wildlife Conservation Society.
	<p>Aside from designing a few t-shirts while in grade school and college, this was my first foray into t-shirt design for work. I had a lot of fun since it's different from my usual projects, and was completely self-directed. I decided early on that I wanted to include an animal pun and sketched three additional ideas involving porpoises, lions, and koalas, before settling on this one.</p>
