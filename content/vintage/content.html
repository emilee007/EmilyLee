    <h2>Vintage Seltzer</h2>
    <h4>art direction, branding, illustration, packaging</h4>
    <p>I rebranded Vintage Seltzer Water by giving it a more youthful look. The logotype is friendly and rounded, with bubbles overlaid in a playful manner. The illustrations on the cans appeals to a younger crowd, as a healthier alternative to soda. The new branding is meant to show that drinking Vintage Seltzer is refreshing, taking you on an underwater journey.</p>
	<p>To distinguish between different flavors, each flavor is represented by different colors. The original features a treasure chest with bubbles, while the other flavors feature an open oyster shell with fruit in place of a pearl.</p>
