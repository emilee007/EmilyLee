    <h2>Rock of Ages</h2>
    <h4>branding, interactive</h4>
    <p>As an Interactive Designer at <a href="http://www.situationinteractive.com">Situation Interactive</a>, I designed the website, e-mail, banners, and landing pages for the Broadway and Las Vegas productions of the <a href="http://www.rockofagesmusical.com">ROCK OF AGES</a> musical.</p>
	<p>I enjoyed working on the ROCK OF AGES brand since I was able to create flashy, original art (including graffiti on a bathroom stall and neon signs) that complemented the show for the interior pages of the website and landing pages.</p>
