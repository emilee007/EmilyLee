    <h2>If/Then</h2>
    <h4>branding, interactive</h4>
    <p>As an Interactive Designer at <a href="http://www.situationinteractive.com">Situation Interactive</a>, I designed e-mail, banners, and social media assets (including contests and bumper images) for Broadway Musical <a href="http://www.ifthenthemusical.com">If/Then</a>.</p>
	<p>Translating If/Then's print artwork to digital formats proved to be particularly challenging, as the artwork transitioned from being illustration-only to a marriage of illustration and photography.</p>
	<p>One of the most interesting campaigns that I was able to work on was a full takeover of <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com">BroadwayWorld.com</a>. It was a really cool experience designing each individual component, and being able to see them all come together live on the website.</p>
