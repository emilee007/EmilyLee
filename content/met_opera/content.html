    <h2>The Metropolitan Opera</h2>
    <h4>branding, interactive, motion</h4>
    <p>As an Interactive Designer at <a href="http://www.situationinteractive.com">Situation Interactive</a>, I designed landing pages and e-mail, as well as storyboarded and developed flash banners for <a href="http://www.metopera.org">The Metropolitan Opera</a>. I enjoyed working on The Metropolitan brand because of its elegant, sophisticated image and the fact that I was able to work with many beautiful production photos. I particularly like the “At the Met” banners, which show the the experience of going to the Met through the panning of photos.</p>
