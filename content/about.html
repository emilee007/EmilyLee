<div id="about">
    <h1>Hi! I'm Emily. Nice to meet you.</h1>
    <p>I’m a graphic designer and visual thinker, who strives to create playful, engaging interactive solutions. An ambitious and quick learner with boundless imagination, I am always excited to take on the next challenge, and to explore its creative possibilities. With over five years of experience designing for a variety of industries, including media, healthcare, theater, finance, advertising, and non-profit organizations, I’ve been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to develop my ability to adapt my design aesthetic to a range of brands and styles.</p>
    <p>I am an alumnus of the <a href="http://www.pratt.edu/academics/art_design/art_grad/grad_communications_design/">M.S. Communications Design</a> program at <a href="http://www.pratt.edu">Pratt Institute</a>, and the <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/interdisciplinary/programs/bhaprogram.html">B.H.A. </a> program from <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I concentrated in Fine Arts and Creative and Professional Writing and  minored in Business Administration.  Coming from a&nbsp;multidisciplinary background, I enjoy working across media,
        bridging my varied interests in my design work, from illustration to animation. I am particularly interested in creating original artwork and studying&nbsp;UI/UX design, illustration, typography, and information design.</p>
    <p>I am currently enjoying my role as a Visual Designer at <a href="http://www.isobar.com/us/home">Isobar</a>, but please feel free to send an e-mail my way if you'd like to work together on a creative project.</p>
