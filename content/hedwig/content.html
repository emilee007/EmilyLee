    <h2>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</h2>
    <h4>branding, interactive, motion</h4>
    <p>As an Interactive Designer at <a href="http://www.situationinteractive.com">Situation Interactive</a>, I designed e-mail, as well as storyboarded and developed flash banners for <a href="http://hedwigbroadway.com">HEDWIG</a>, the Broadway musical.</p>
	<p>I enjoyed working on HEDWIG because its branding truly stands apart from other Broadway shows. I particularly liked working on the flash banners, which are animated in an exciting, dramatic way. I storyboarded and developed the Tony nomination banners and gave creative direction to a freelance flash developer for the Andrew Rannells banners.</p>
