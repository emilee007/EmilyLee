    <h2>Sprout Now iOS TV App</h2>
    <h4>branding, interactive</h4>
    <p>As a Visual Designer at <a href="http://www.isobar.com/us/home">Isobar</a>, I worked extensively on the NBC TVE (TV Everywhere) platforms for the past year (Apple TV, Android, and iOS) for brands including Syfy, Telemundo, Oxygen, Esquire, Sprout, NBC Universo, and MSNBC. The new iOS app includes mobile portrait and landscape, as well as tablet portrait and landscape viewports. Here are select screens from the Sprout Now iOS app, my favorite of the seven brands that I worked on, due to the brand's playful colors and artwork.</p>
