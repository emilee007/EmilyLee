    <h2>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</h2>
    <h4>branding, interactive</h4>
    <p>As an Interactive Designer at <a href="http://www.situationinteractive.com">Situation Interactive</a>, I worked on social assets and banners for <a href="http://www.ripleysnewyork.com">Ripley's Believe It or Not!</a> Below are some bumper images meant to be promoted on Ripley's social channels, such as Facebook and Twitter. These were designed to have a branded template using the same graphic and type treatments, and blue and yellow colors that would appeal to a younger audience.</p>
